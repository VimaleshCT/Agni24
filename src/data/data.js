In this event, students will be divided into (2 to 5) teams of (5 to 7) based on the students’ presence.<br/>
We will provide a glass jar with lots of folded papers inside which the below-mentioned games names will be written.<br/>
Two players from each team will be randomly chosen, and any one of them will be allowed to choose a game randomly from the glass jar.<br/>
Then the chosen game will be played only by those two players.<br/>
Each of them represents their team, and the winner will contribute a score for his/her team.<br/>
Then the next two from both teams will be called, and it goes on.<br/>
Each game only takes 1-2 minutes, so that all players will play a game for their team and add scores to their team.<br/>
All games will take place at the center of the class in front of their teammates so that they will be engaged to earn more points.<br/>
Each team will play 7 to 8 games with their opponent teams. Finally, based on the points, the winner team will be chosen.<br/>
<br/>
LIST OF GAMES:<br/>
1. BIG DICE:<br/>
We have to provide a big paper dice with six numbers on each face. Two players will be called to decide their number and roll the dice for 3 times. Those who get the correct number will be the winner.<br/>
2. CUP KNOCK:<br/>
We have to provide 10 cups for each player. They have to build a pyramid and knock it down with a plastic ball (only using left hand). Calculating the number of fallen cups, the winner will be chosen.<br/>
3. TAPPY TAPPY:<br/>
We have to arrange two sets of 3 cups filled with half water. Two players are allowed to pitch a ball on the desk to fall inside the cup. Those who first complete 3 cups will be the winner.<br/>
4. WHISPER:<br/>
In this game, we need two players in each team. In each team, one will convey the dialogue and the other will find the dialogue with high volume music playing on headphones as a hindrance.<br/>
5. PICK YOUR CARD:<br/>
Players will be allowed to choose 3 random cards. Both have to add the numbers on each card. Those who have the greatest number will be the winner.<br/>
6. L-DRAW:<br/>
One player has to find the picture drawn by another player using the left hand as per the instruction of the organizers.<br/>
7. MYTH OR FACT:<br/>
The participants will be told a statement; they have to analyze and decide whether it is a fact or a myth.<br/>
8. ACT AND FIND:<br/>
It is simply enacting either a movie name or personality depending upon the genre and let the other teammate find it.<br/>
9. DO THE OPPOSITE:<br/>
Participants have to carefully listen to the instructions and do the exact opposite of it.<br/>
10. CONNECTIONS:<br/>
Each set consists of 5 pictures depicting a film, person, or entity that will be given to the players to find. Points are based on the usage of the minimum number of hints.

A fun, new school take on Family Feud. Students team up with their friends (4 or 5 in a team) and participate in this rolling event.<br/>
<br/>
Teams head up against each other and nominate one player to answer a question based on a category.<br/>
The team of the player who answers first gets to choose whether they want to answer questions from either of the two categories given to them. The remaining category is for the opposing team.<br/>
<br/>
Then the teams answer rapid-fire questions on their corresponding categories.<br/>
- The teams can answer questions not from their category if the other team does not answer them, for additional points.<br/>
- If the team with the privilege of choice doesn’t get a single question correct, they receive a handicap for the next round.<br/>
<br/>
The next round is based on the respective categories and includes a list-it-out question.<br/>
The final round will be a long visual connect.<br/>
<br/>
After all teams are done, the teams with the three highest scores are announced as the winners. In case of a tie, the time taken for each round is considered.
