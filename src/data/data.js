Each of them represents their team, and the winner will contribute a score for his/her team.<br/>
Then the next two from both teams will be called, and it goes on.<br/>
Each game only takes 1-2 minutes, so that all players will play a game for their team and add scores to their team.<br/>
All games will take place at the center of the class in front of their teammates so that they will be engaged to earn more points.<br/>
Each team will play 7 to 8 games with their opponent teams. Finally, based on the points, the winner team will be chosen.<br/>

5. PICK YOUR CARD:<br/>
Players will be allowed to choose 3 random cards. Both have to add the numbers on each card. Those who have the greatest number will be the winner.<br/>

A fun, new school take on Family Feud. Students team up with their friends (4 or 5 in a team) and participate in this rolling event.<br/>

Teams head up against each other and nominate one player to answer a question based on a category.<br/>
The team of the player who answers first gets to choose whether they want to answer questions from either of the two categories given to them. The remaining category is for the opposing team.<br/>

Astronauts were set on a course to find a habitable planet, but during their cryo sleep, the software malfunctioned, and they ended up in a wrong star.<br/>
The goal is to correct the course and check the possible evidence of life.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Round 1:</strong><br/>
- Setting the right course for the galaxy using the reference stars given in the image.<br/>
- Send the probe to the planet: Finding the right coordinates (Number games).<br/>
- Find the signs of life from the details sent by a probe to the planet (perceptual illusions).<br/>
- Decode the signal.<br/>
  (There will be two sets of questions, A and B, to minimize malpractice. Each set of questions will have different answers. For example, set A will give a clue for life, and set B will give a clue for water.)<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Round 2:</strong><br/>
- Alien encounter: Decoding the signal sent by aliens (space pirates).<br/>
- If an alien attacks your spaceship, the repaired part must be found by following the given clues.<br/>
- After deflecting their attack, find your planet.<br/>
- Locate the suitable landing spot.<br/>

    - The moderator presents a series of clues, which may be words, phrases, or images, that all share a hidden connection.<br/><br/>
    
    <strong>Rounds:</strong><br/>
    - Each round consists of a set of four clues.<br/>
    - Players must figure out the connection between the clues, which could be a theme, category, or common word association.<br/><br/>
    
    <strong>Clue Examples:</strong><br/>
    - Clues: Apple, Amazon, River, Table — <em>Connection:</em> They are all things you can "set."<br/>
    - Clues: Shark, Superman, Space, Star — <em>Connection:</em> They are all names of famous movies.<br/>
